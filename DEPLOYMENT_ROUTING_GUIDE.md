# SPA Routing Fix for Deployment

This guide explains how the Single Page Application (SPA) routing issue has been fixed for deployment.

## Problem

When refreshing a page on a deployed SPA (like `/admin/dashboard`), the server returns a 404 error because it tries to find a file at that path instead of serving the React app.

## Solution

Multiple configuration files have been added to handle SPA routing for different hosting platforms:

### 1. Vercel Configuration (`client/vercel.json`)

```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Netlify Configuration (`client/public/_redirects`)

```
/*    /index.html   200
```

### 3. Apache Configuration (`client/public/.htaccess`)

```apache
Options -MultiViews
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteRule ^ index.html [QSA,L]
```

### 4. React Router Catch-All Route

Added a catch-all route in `App.tsx`:

```tsx
<Route path="*" element={<NotFound />} />
```

## Files Added/Modified

### New Files:

- `client/vercel.json` - Vercel deployment configuration
- `client/public/_redirects` - Netlify deployment configuration
- `client/public/.htaccess` - Apache server configuration
- `client/src/pages/NotFound.tsx` - 404 page component

### Modified Files:

- `client/src/App.tsx` - Added catch-all route and NotFound import

## How It Works

1. **Server-Level**: Configuration files tell the server to serve `index.html` for all routes
2. **Client-Level**: React Router handles the routing and shows appropriate components
3. **Fallback**: If a route doesn't exist, the NotFound component is displayed

## Testing

After deployment, test these scenarios:

1. Navigate to `/admin/dashboard` and refresh the page
2. Navigate to `/product` and refresh the page
3. Try accessing a non-existent route like `/nonexistent`
4. All should work without 404 errors

## Deployment Instructions

### For Vercel:

1. The `vercel.json` file will be automatically detected
2. Deploy as usual - routing will work correctly

### For Netlify:

1. The `_redirects` file will be automatically detected
2. Deploy as usual - routing will work correctly

### For Other Platforms:

- Use the appropriate configuration file for your hosting platform
- Ensure all routes redirect to `index.html`

## Token Refresh Enhancement

Additionally, the token refresh mechanism has been improved:

1. **Proactive Refresh**: Tokens are refreshed 5 minutes before expiration
2. **Automatic Retry**: Failed requests due to expired tokens are automatically retried
3. **Better Error Handling**: Improved logging and error handling for token refresh
4. **Extended Token Life**: Access tokens now expire in 1 hour instead of 15 minutes

The system now handles token expiration seamlessly without user intervention.
